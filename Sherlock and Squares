// My approach is that as soon you find the first perfect square, eg. number 4 = 2 * 2, the next perfect square after 4 would be 9 = 3 * 3, and so on. 
// Here is my code in Java.


        int count = 0;

        for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
            int sq = (int) Math.sqrt(i);
            if (i == sq * sq) {
                count++;
                i = (sq + 1) * (sq + 1) - 1;
            }
        }

        return count;
